# E-commerce backend

This projects goal was to create a backend for an E-commerce application that would allow a manager to use the program to compete with other e-commerce companies. The main goal was to create an application that would utilize tools including MySQL, Sequelize, and JavaScript to create routes including GET,POST,PUT, and DELETE. This allows for the capability to modify the information in the server allowing for it to be kept up to date.
